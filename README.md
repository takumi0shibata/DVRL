# DVRL for AES Project

Welcome to the DVRL_on_torch project! This project is primarily focused on training the DVRL (Data Valuation using Reinforcement Learning) model using PyTorch. The main objective is to provide a robust framework for evaluating the value of data in various machine learning tasks, thereby enhancing model performance through data valuation.

## Getting Started

To embark on this project, ensure Python is installed on your system. You will also need to install a number of dependencies detailed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. To install the necessary dependencies, execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.

### Usage

To commence training the DVRL model, execute the `train_dvrl.py` script. This script is designed to accept multiple command-line arguments, allowing for a tailored training experience. Below is an example command:
```
python train_dvrl.py --test_prompt_id 1
```
